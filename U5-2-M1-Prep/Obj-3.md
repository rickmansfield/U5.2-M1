# Unit 5.2 M1 Objective 3 challenge

## Challenge
1) What is the number of possible integer values you can store with 4 bytes? How did you make that calculation?
-  8bits/1byte x 4 bytes = 32 bits 
- 2^32 =  4,294,967,296 bit size

2) What is the number of possible integer values you can store with 8 bytes? How did you make that calculation?

- 8 x 8  = 64 bits
- 2^64 =  18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bit size
