# Unit 5.2 M1 Homework Task 2

Q) Why does the processor get a speed boost when the processor access nearby memory addresses in RAM one after the other?
a.   Because of the cache?
b.  Because the mathematical computations that the processor completes to find the next item in memory takes less time than the necessary calculations to find things that are further away?
c.  Because the mechanical spinning hard disk takes less time to access items that are next to each other?

My guess was "b."
