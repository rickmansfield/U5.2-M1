# Unit 5.2 M1 Homework Task 4

Q) If each slot in memory holds 8 bits and we want to store an array of 64-bit integers, how many memory addresses will be required to store an array of 5 integers. 

8 bits = 1 byte
there are 5 64bit integers 
5 x 64 = 320 bits
320 bits / 8 = 40 

or 

(320 bits /1) X (1byte / 8bits) 

320 bits        1 byte
________    x _________ = 320/8 bytes= 40 bytes 
   1            8 bits
